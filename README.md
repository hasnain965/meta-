# ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for an ERC20 token and a vault.

## ERC20 Token Contract

### Overview

The ERC20 token contract implements the ERC20 standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create, transfer, and manage tokens.

### Features

- Minting: Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens.
- Burning: Allows token holders to burn (destroy) their tokens.
- Material Redemption: Allows token holders to redeem tokens for specific materials.

### Usage

1. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network.
2. Mint tokens to distribute them among users or hold an initial supply.
3. Users can transfer tokens to other addresses or burn them if needed.
4. Users can redeem tokens for specific materials by interacting with the contract's `redeemMaterial` function.

## Vault Contract

### Overview

The vault contract provides a secure storage mechanism for tokens, allowing authorized users to deposit and withdraw tokens.

### Features

- Deposit: Allows users to deposit tokens into the vault.
- Withdrawal: Allows users to withdraw tokens from the vault, subject to withdrawal limits and permissions.
- Access Control: Implements access control mechanisms to restrict actions to authorized users.

### Usage

1. Deploy the vault contract to an Ethereum network.
2. Set up access control roles, specifying which addresses have permission to deposit and withdraw tokens.
3. Users with the appropriate permissions can deposit tokens into the vault using the `deposit` function.
4. Authorized users can withdraw tokens from the vault using the `withdraw` function, subject to any withdrawal limits or conditions set by the contract owner.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can deploy these contracts to an Ethereum network using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. Once deployed, you can interact with the contracts using a compatible Ethereum wallet or through custom applications.

For more detailed instructions on deploying and interacting with the contracts, refer to the contract documentation and relevant Ethereum development resources.
